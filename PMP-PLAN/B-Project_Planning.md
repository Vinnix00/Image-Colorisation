# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle

The project management life cycle is represented and documented in the form of a Gantt Chart, which allows staff to follow guidelines and meet milestones on a regular basis. The project life cycle divides the tasks and work of each member, such as the project manager, into several modules. Based on the Work Breakdown Structure constructed, each member has their own roles and parts in each stage of the lifecycle.
Work Breakdown Structure is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

### Scope
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is created to map out all of the necessary tasks and to develop the process that will be maintained and approved for the WBS.

In this image colorization project, we need to identify the scope of the project. For instance, the project is not able to colorize some image naturaly and visually accepted. The colorize image might not look nice and the color used may not be suitable.

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Poor attitude toward quality; substandard design, materials, and workmanship; inadequate quality assurance program)|1. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The system will also colorize the RGB images <br><br> 2. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The quality of the AI model is biased towards a certain colorized images.  |How: The output image will colorize the RGB images into other colors<br> <br> When: The quality problem is determined during the testing phase|Assign one member to keep on collecting the data day to day and increased the training process until a satisfied result is determined.|
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)|1. Contigency: The costing of the system will be spike if the system faces errors and bugs. <br><br> 2. Inadequate productivity: Team members are affected by Covid-19 and unable to deliver what they suppossed to deliver which lead to extra cost and time need to allocated. |How: The monthly bills shows unexpected extra charged to the bills.<br><br>When: The problem most probably will be encountered during the project execution and project implementation.|Notify the owner through email or discord if the budget exceed threshold.
|Time <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products) | 1. Project not able to reach the milestone set  as described in the Gantt Chart. <br><br> 2. Erros in estimating resource availability: There are not enough dataset to be used to run the image colorization model training  |How: The members are stuck with a certain problem and drag all the other team members <br><br> When: The problem will be encountered during the project excution and monitoring phase.| Ask support from the other team member and switch their task or job to other job to avoid him/her to stuck in the problem loop.|
