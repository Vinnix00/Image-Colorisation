# Image Colorization System
This is a project that add color to a grayscale input image to produce a colorful result. This project use Atificial Intelligence (AI) technique such as Deep Learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The project is developed by following Project Management Plan (PMP) to better organized the lifecycle of the project. Several charting techniques such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is used to manage the project.

The PMP-Plan developed is simply a simulation collaboration between third party organization.

## Project Management Plan
##### Project Summary: [Project Summary](PMP-PLAN/A-Project_Summary.md)
Project Summary gives a brief overview of the project objectives and team member details.

##### Project Planning: [Project Planning](PMP-PLAN/B-Project_Planning.md)

##### Project Implementation: [Project Implementation](PMP-PLAN/C-Project_Implementation.md)
Project Implementation define the project deliverables which included software requirement, intelligent system architecture and etc.

##### Project Execution: [Project Execution](PMP-PLAN/D-Project_Execution.md)
Project Execution is the execution phase where the result, coding blocks and technical implementation are defined and documented.

##### Project Closing: [Project Closing](PMP-PLAN/E-Project_Closing.md)
Project Closing indicate the end of the project lifecycle where the project need to document closing document and lesson learnt report.
